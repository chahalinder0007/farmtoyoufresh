`react-markdown` is a markdown component for React.

Changes are re-rendered as you type.

Try writing some markdown on the left.

## Overview

- Follows [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)
- Optionally follows [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- Renders actual React elements instead of using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Lets you define your own components (to render `MyHeading` instead of `h1`)
- Has a lot of plugins
